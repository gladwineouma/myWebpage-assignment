        <h1 style="background-color:powderblue;">My experirnce at AkiraChix</h1>
        <p style="font-style: oblique;">It has been a while since I steppped out of our house and start living somewhere else not near within my family.br As from highschool my end-day destination has been in my parent's house having a moment with my family. But now I happen to relocate to a new place, a new environment with different people. In as much as I am away from home I can say AkiraChix is home away from home. Having different people around you from different places who are friendly and accommodative is such a good feeling. All the people in AkiraChix fraternity are good. </p>
